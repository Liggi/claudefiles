# Right Panel

Read the tmux pane and perform the requested action on what you see.

## Instructions:

1. Read the content of the Neovim/Terminal tmux pane (usually pane 3)
2. If arguments are provided, perform the specified action on what's displayed
3. If no arguments are provided, intelligently infer what the user likely wants based on what's shown (fix errors, explain output, continue a process, etc.)
4. Keep responses concise and action-focused

Now read the pane and perform the requested action.
